## Challenge Overview
>Deliverable 1: The Election Results Printed to the Command Line
>Deliverable 2: The Election Results Saved to a Text File
The most difficult part of this project was appropriately nesting code blocks to acheive complete and accurate results. 
Creating the loops and referencing other files was challenging as well. 

## Challenge Summary
#####County Votes:
-Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
-Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
-Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

#####Largest County Turnout: Denver
County Vote Count: 306,055
## Outcomes
We can see from this data set that Denver County had the highest voter turnout. If we had population data or voter registration data we could start to look at why Denver had the vast majority of voters in this election. 
We know from this data set that Diana DeGette won the election.
